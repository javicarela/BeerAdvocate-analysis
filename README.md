### The output of this repository is available here: **https://rpubs.com/JaviCarela/Beer-reviews-analysis**

The objective of this analysis is to answer a series of questions related to a dataset of beers.
The dataset to be analyzed is a file containing 1.5 million beer ratings made by Beer Advocate https://www.beeradvocate.com/ .The data set is available at the following link <https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate>.
The file is not in the repository because it is larger than 25 MB.

The questions you are asked to answer are as follows: 
1. If you had to choose three beers using only this data, by what criteria and which ones would you choose?
2. Which beer would you recommend if I mainly value aroma and appearance (arome and appearance)?
3. How would you classify the beers? What are the characteristics of the classification?
4. How do the factors (arome, taste, appearance, palette) influence the overall quality of a beer? Which is the most important?

For data manipulation and drawing conclusions with data analysis tools we will use the software R.
